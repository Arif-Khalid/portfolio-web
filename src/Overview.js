      <h1>About</h1>
      My name is Arif. I am a Computer Eningeering student currently studying at
      the National University of Singapore. I am always looking to improve
      myself by learning and building new things. This website was not made
      through any template but my own hard work, following over 100 hours of
      courses, starting all the way from JavaScript fundamentals.
